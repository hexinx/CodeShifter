# CodeShifter 1.01

![alt tag](https://github.com/hexinx/CodeShifter/blob/master/04_ScreenShots/1.jpg)

The National Security Agney (NSA) holds a CodeBreaker Challenge each year. Participants from across the world get to reverse engineering and "break" software during tasks in the challenge.   This year (2016), there were 6 tasks. This program was coded to solve tasks of the challenge (NSA Codebreaker challenge 2016). You can modify parameters according to variables used in your binaries. 

For use in solution/answers of Tasks:

Task 3,Task 4,Task 5, and Task 6.

The code (at places) might not be too "clean", I'm sorry for that. After all, I made this program just to "get things done", and not for demonstration of efficient coding ;)

# Compile+Run only in x86!
You'll HAVE TO COMPILE/RUN in 32 bits ONLY! Something goes wrong in the brute-force procedure when you do it otherwise (atleast on Windows 10). I haven't figured out what it is yet, and I don't intend to do so. If you do figure it out, do let me know!

# Usage
You'll need to copy the binaries and key files to the application start-up directory before you can use it.
I've included the private/public keys that were present in my binaries. I'm not sure if NSA used the same keys for every one else's binaries. But, in case they did, you can simply use the ones I've provided.

# Outro ;)
I'd love to hear from you if: You just want to say hi, if you found this useful, if you use my code, if you solved task 6, or if you want to team up for 2017's challenge ;)

Again, I'd love to heard from you!
