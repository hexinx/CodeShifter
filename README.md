The National Security Agney (NSA) holds a CodeBreaker Challenge each year. Participants from across the world get to reverse engineering and "break" software during tasks in the challenge.   This year (2016), there were 6 tasks. This program was coded to solve tasks of the challenge. You can modify parameters according to variables used in your binaries.
